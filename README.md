# Ignition-AreawiseAlarmsCounter
Ignition SCADA demo project to count areawise alarms

**Tested with Ignition's Official Demo project and Demo db*

Ubuntu 18.04

Java -- openjdk version "1.8.0_181"

.......................

This Alarm counter template can filter any string in the "Template properties/Displaypath" filter and can display the filtered alarms count. This is case insensitive. You can cross check by filtering Alarms in the "Alarm status table/Display Path Filter" and copy/paste the same string into this template's filter.

**Note: "Alarm status table/Display Path Filter" is case sensitive.**

......................

Upload this "AreawiseAlarmsCounter.proj" on the same GW server where Ignition's Official Demo projec is running and test it.
